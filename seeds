Interesting seeds:
---------------------
1333929076216 - flock forms, then someone gets infected, then flock disperses
1333989171647 - 10 agents, good to see eradication of disease, naive clustering
1334034695569 emergent flocking, pretty cool to watch
1334035808374 flocking on, avoid sick. groups are chased by sick who infect them all.
1335019901343 with "-disease none -flocking 0": agents still get stuck when they see no food
